# Mr. Coffee - Static Website
This site is used for the students of INCO Academy's INCODE Bootcamp to see an example of what their site might look like. Mr. Coffee is a fictional caf√© based in Paris, France that students were required to build a static website for using vanilla HTML and CSS.

## Notes on CSS
Some values that I either learnt while putting this project together or that I believe are worth checking out for more dynamic css:
- custom properties and the general thinking that goes along with what should be a custom property/variable
- min(), max(), clamp()
- calc()
- absolute vertical centering
